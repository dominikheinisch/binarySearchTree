# binarySearchTree

Binary Search Tree: a generic data structure written in C++. It stores data in tree stucture,
that allows insert, remove, in average logaritmic time complexity in big O notation. It also features tree traversal method: in-order,
pre-order, post-order, level-order.

TestBST: it includes tests of all the most popular methods, based on primitive type int.
Additionally, _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC is used in order to ensure that there are no memory leaks.
